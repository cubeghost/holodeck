# Holodeck
### a positively holographic asset management tool
----
holodeck is a tool I built to help internally manage stickers and backgrounds for [Glitter](https://glitter.club/). we were originally calling everything 'stickers', but wanted a better metaphor for visual objects, thus, we came up with 'holograms'. at that point we couldn't avoid calling the tool the holodeck.

it runs on:
- Go
- MongoDB
- React.js

you'll need:
- a webserver
- an amazon S3 bucket
